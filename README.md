## 📋 Implementation Details

### Glass-morphism Effect

The app uses modern CSS techniques to create a trendy glass-morphism effect:

```css
.todo-app {
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 100px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  border: 3px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

### Local Storage Implementation

Tasks persist between sessions using browser's local storage:

```javascript
// Save tasks to local storage
const saveTasksToLocalStorage = () => {
  const tasks = Array.from(taskList.querySelectorAll('li')).map(li => ({
    text: li.querySelector('span').textContent,
    completed: li.querySelector('.checkbox').checked
  }));
  
  localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
};

// Load tasks from local storage
const loadTasksFromLocalStorage = () => {
  const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')) || [];
  tasks.forEach(task => {
    addTask(task.text, task.completed);
  });
};
```

### Word of the Day Feature

Motivational words change on scroll and daily:

```javascript
// Motivational words array with meanings
const motivationalWords = [
  { word: "FOCUS", meaning: "Follow One Course Until Success" },
  { word: "PUSH", meaning: "Persist Until Something Happens" },
  // ...more words
];

// Set random motivational word with animation
const setRandomWord = () => {
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * motivationalWords.length);
  const wordObj = motivationalWords[randomIndex];
  motivationalWord.textContent = wordObj.word;
  wordMeaning.textContent = wordObj.meaning;
  
  // Apply a new animation
  const wordElement = document.querySelector('.word-of-day');
  wordElement.classList.remove('aos-animate');
  setTimeout(() => {
    wordElement.classList.add('aos-animate');
  }, 100);
};
```

### Progress Tracking

Visual feedback on task completion:

```javascript
const updateStats = () => {
  totalTasks = taskList.children.length;
  completedTasks = document.querySelectorAll('#task-list li.completed').length;
  
  // Update the progress bar
  const progressPercentage = totalTasks === 0 ? 0 : (completedTasks / totalTasks) * 100;
  progress.style.width = `${progressPercentage}%`;
  
  // Update the numbers display
  numbers.textContent = `${completedTasks} / ${totalTasks}`;
  
  // Trigger confetti when all tasks are completed
  if (!isInitialLoad && totalTasks > 0 && completedTasks === totalTasks) {
    Confetti();
  }
};
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Color Scheme

Edit the CSS variables in `style.css` to change the app's colors:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #ff6f91;
  --secondary-color: #ffbf00;
  --bg-color: rgba(255, 194, 209, 0.3);
  --text-color: #fff;
  --completed-color: #000;
}
```

### Adding New Motivational Words

Add new acronyms to the `motivationalWords` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
const motivationalWords = [
  // Existing words...
  { word: "YOUR_WORD", meaning: "Your Word's Motivational Meaning" },
];
```

### Customizing Confetti Animation

Modify the confetti parameters in `script.js`:

```javascript
const defaults = {
  spread: 360,            // Spread angle (degrees)
  ticks: 50,              // Lifetime (higher = longer lasting)
  gravity: 0,             // How fast particles fall
  decay: 0.94,            // How fast particles fade out
  startVelocity: 30,      // Initial velocity
  shapes: ["star"],       // Particle shapes
  colors: ["FFE400", "FFBD00", "E89400", "FFCA6C", "FDFFB8"],  // Colors
};
