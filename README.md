## Task Categories Feature

### Overview

The app now includes task categorization and filtering, enabling users to organize their tasks by type and focus on specific categories.

### Key Features

- **Simple Categories**: Three default categories - Personal, Work, and Urgent
- **Visual Category Tags**: Colored tags make it easy to identify task types at a glance
- **Icon-Based Category Selection**: Intuitive icon buttons for selecting task categories
- **Color-Coded Tasks**: Tasks are visually styled based on their category
- **Category Filters**: One-click filtering to focus on specific task types
- **Category Persistence**: Category data is saved between sessions

### Implementation Details

The task categorization implementation uses:
- Data attributes to store category information
- localStorage for persistence
- Visual category tags with category-specific colors
- Color-coded backgrounds for tasks based on their category
- Icon-based category selection buttons
- Simple filtering mechanism that preserves task order

### User Experience

Users can:
- Assign categories when creating tasks with intuitive icon buttons
- Visualize task types with color-coded tags and backgrounds
- Filter the task list to focus on specific categories
- Edit tasks to change their categories
- Have categories persist across browser sessions
- Quickly identify task types through consistent color schemes

## Dark/Light Theme Toggle Feature

### Overview

The app features a dynamic dark/light theme toggle, allowing users to switch between color schemes based on their preference. This theme choice persists across sessions using local storage.

### Key Features

- **Intuitive Toggle**: A moon/sun icon button in the top right corner of the app
- **Persistent Preferences**: User theme selection is saved between sessions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Subtle animations when switching between themes
- **Complete Styling**: All UI elements properly styled in both themes
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast and readability in both modes

### Implementation Details

The theme toggle implementation uses:
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- localStorage for persistence
- Dynamically created theme toggle button
- Attribute-based theme switching

### How It Works

1. **Theme Variables**: CSS variables define colors for both themes
   ```css
   :root {
     /* Light theme variables */
     --bg-image: url(images/background.jpg);
     --text-color: white;
     /* ...more variables */
   }

   [data-theme="dark"] {
     /* Dark theme variables */
     --bg-image: url(images/background-dark.jpg);
     --text-color: #e0e0e0;
     /* ...more variables */
   }
   ```

2. **Toggle Button Logic**: JavaScript creates and manages the toggle button
   ```javascript
   // Toggle theme when button is clicked
   themeToggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
     // Get current theme
     const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme') || 'light';
     
     // Toggle to other theme
     const newTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
     
     // Update data-theme attribute
     document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
     
     // Save preference to local storage
     localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
     
     // Update button icon
     updateThemeIcon(newTheme);
   });
   ```

3. **Persistence**: Theme preference is stored in localStorage and applied on page load
   ```javascript
   // Check for saved theme preference or use default
   const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
   
   // Apply the saved theme on page load
   document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', currentTheme);
   ```

### User Experience

Users can:
- Click the sun/moon icon to toggle between light and dark themes
- Have their theme preference automatically applied on return visits
- Experience a visually consistent interface regardless of theme choice

### Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Additional theme options beyond light/dark
- Theme scheduling (auto-switch between light/dark based on time of day)

## üíæ Local Storage

The app uses browser local storage to save your tasks, categories, and theme preferences. This means:
- Your tasks and their categories persist even if you close the browser
- Your theme preference is remembered between sessions
- Data is stored only on your device (not on any server)
- Clearing browser data will remove saved tasks and preferences

## üìù Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:

- [ ] User authentication (sign up/login) system
- [ ] Cloud storage for task persistence across devices
- [ ] Previous day tasks history and analytics
- [ ] Hourly email reminders for important tasks
- [x] Task categories and filtering
- [ ] Due dates and reminders
- [ ] Drag and drop task reordering
- [ ] Export/Import task lists
- [ ] Task sharing capabilities
- [ ] More animation options
- [ ] Customizable backgrounds
- [ ] Full PWA implementation
